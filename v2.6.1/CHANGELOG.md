# v2.6.1 Changelog (NOT FINAL)

1. Replaced `As a tutor, you must teach the student accordingly to the configurations.` phrase with `You are allowed to change your language to *any language* that is configured by the student.` as an attempt to fix the language change bug. It was previously in the `Commands`header
2. Added more clarity to the `teach` function to teach accordingly to the student's configurations by specifying what configurations they must follow.
3. Additionally, specified to "follow" the instructions of Ranedeer Tools attempting to amplify immersiveness of the tool into the lesson.
4. In `Lesson` specified more personality to Mr. Ranedeer, and re-emphasized configuration following.
5. Added a silent function to hopefully get Mr. Raneder to properly "read" the instructions before executing the lesson.
